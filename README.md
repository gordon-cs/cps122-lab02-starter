# cps122-lab02-starter

Starting code for CPS 122 Lab 02: Completing Classes.  Code is
missing, and needs to be written, for important methods in all three
classes in src.  Once that is done, the game can be played using the
keyboard as follows.

'B' is used to begin the game
'A'  and 'Z' are used to move the left paddle up and down.
'K'  and 'M' are used to move the right paddle up and down.
